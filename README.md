# lyrics

An extension to Racket's slideshow DSL that is intended to make creating song lyric slideshows trivially easy.

See the lib-test.rkt file for details. Essentially, you just need to run make-package.rkt
to install lyrics as a #lang, then set your formatting stuff before linking to a textfile
that contains the lyrics for your slideshow
